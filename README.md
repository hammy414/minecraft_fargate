## Features

### On-Demand Activation: No more manual server management! The server springs to life when players want to play.
Serverless Framework: Utilizing AWS Fargate, we bypass the need for dedicated instances, making deployment easier and more scalable.
Cost-Efficiency: By operating only when needed, costs are significantly reduced compared to 24/7 dedicated servers.
Persistent Storage: With Amazon EFS integration, never worry about losing your precious game data.

### Project Background
Minecraft, a world-renowned game, often requires hosting solutions for multiplayer interactions. AWS Fargate introduces a way to do this without constant server management or high costs. By containerizing the server and employing a series of AWS triggers, we've created a dynamic solution that balances performance with cost.
